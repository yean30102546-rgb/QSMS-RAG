## Chroma Cloud

Our hosted service, Chroma Cloud, powers serverless vector, hybrid, and full-text search. It's extremely fast, cost-effective, scalable and painless. Create a DB and try it out in under 30 seconds with $5 of free credits.

[Get started with Chroma Cloud](https://trychroma.com/signup)

## API

The core API is only 4 functions (run our [💡 Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QEzFyqnoFxq7LUGyP1vzR4iLt9PpCDXv?usp=sharing)):

```
import chromadb
# setup Chroma in-memory, for easy prototyping. Can add persistence easily!
client = chromadb.Client()

# Create collection. get_collection, get_or_create_collection, delete_collection also available!
collection = client.create_collection("all-my-documents")

# Add docs to the collection. Can also update and delete. Row-based API coming soon!
collection.add(
    documents=["This is document1", "This is document2"], # we handle tokenization, embedding, and indexing automatically. You can skip that and add your own embeddings as well
    metadatas=[{"source": "notion"}, {"source": "google-docs"}], # filter on these!
    ids=["doc1", "doc2"], # unique for each doc
)

# Query/search 2 most similar results. You can also .get by id
results = collection.query(
    query_texts=["This is a query document"],
    n_results=2,
    # where={"metadata_field": "is_equal_to_this"}, # optional filter
    # where_document={"$contains":"search_string"}  # optional filter
)
```
